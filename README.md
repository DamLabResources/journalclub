### Generative Models

#### Generating and designing DNA with deep generative models [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06148)]
Nathan Killoran, Leo J. Lee, Andrew Delong, David Duvenaud, Brendan J. Frey 

An exploration of a GANN architecture for creating novel DNA segments. The paper explores the biological nature of model. It has abiity to replicate complementarity. It has smooth transitions in sequence-space when interpolating in Z-space. They then explore applications for this in designing DNA probes with idealized binding properties.
