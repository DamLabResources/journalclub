### Generative Models

#### Generating and designing DNA with deep generative models [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06148)]
Nathan Killoran, Leo J. Lee, Andrew Delong, David Duvenaud, Brendan J. Frey 

An exploration of a GANN architecture for creating novel DNA segments. The paper explores the biological nature of model. It has abiity to replicate complementarity. It has smooth transitions in sequence-space when interpolating in Z-space. They then explore applications for this in designing DNA probes with idealized binding properties.

### CRISPR/Cas9 off-target predicting models

### Predicting off-target cleavage sites using ensemble learning with scoring matrices.
Shixiong Zhang, Xiangtao Li, Qiuzhen Lin and Ka-Chun Wong

A basic benchmark of prediction ability among classification algorithms and combinations of them. The ensemble model using CFD, MIT, MIT Website score, Cropit and CCTop altogether had the highest AUC-ROC and AUC-PRC.
