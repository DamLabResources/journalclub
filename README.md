### Generative Models

#### Generating and designing DNA with deep generative models [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06148)]
Nathan Killoran, Leo J. Lee, Andrew Delong, David Duvenaud, Brendan J. Frey 

An exploration of a GANN architecture for creating novel DNA segments. The paper explores the biological nature of model. It has abiity to replicate complementarity. It has smooth transitions in sequence-space when interpolating in Z-space. They then explore applications for this in designing DNA probes with idealized binding properties.

### CRISPR/Cas9 off-target predicting models

#### Predicting off-target cleavage sites using ensemble learning with scoring matrices.
Shixiong Zhang, Xiangtao Li, Qiuzhen Lin and Ka-Chun Wong

A basic benchmark of prediction ability among classification algorithms and combinations of them. The ensemble model using CFD, MIT, MIT Website score, Cropit and CCTop altogether had the highest AUC-ROC and AUC-PRC. 

Presented by Cheng-Han Chung. [Slides](slidedecks/2019-01-11-crispr-ensemble/Zhang-2018June.ipynb)

### Xpresso - Predicting mRNA abundance using deep learning

#### Predicting mRNA abundance directly from genomic sequence using deep convolutional neural networks. [BioArxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/10/12/416685.full.pdf)
Vikram Agarwal & Jay Shendure

A convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to predict mRNA steady-state abundance from promoter sequence and mRNA half-life proxy. It explains 59% of the variation in expression for humans and 71% of the expression for mice, more than doubling the performance accuracy of previous models attempting to explain transcription. 

Presented by Robert Link. [Slides](slidedecks/2019-01-18-Xpresso/2019_01_18_Xpresso.ipynb)

### Embedding - word2vec-based encodings for biological sequences

#### dna2vec: Consistent vector representations of variable-length k-mers.
Patrick Ng

#### Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences for Deep Proteomics and Genomics
Ehsaneddin Asgari, Mohammad R. K. Mofrad

Embeddings are popular in the deep learning community as inputs to models, and these two specific tools are designed for processing and representing dna/protein sequences. The vector arithmetic for dna2vec representations is analogous to nucleotide concatenation using (Spearman = 0.831), and ProtVec protein classification accuracy is 93%.

### Gene Ontology

#### GOATOOLS: A Python library for Gene Ontology analyses. [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28948-z.pdf)
D. V. Klopfenstein, Liangsheng Zhang, Brent S. Pedersen, Fidel Ramírez, Alex Warwick Vesztrocy, Aurélien Naldi, Christopher J. Mungall, Jeffrey M. Yunes, Olga Botvinnik, Mark Weigel, Will Dampier, Christophe Dessimoz, Patrick Flick, Haibao Tang

Gene Ontology (GO) is used to describe gene products in a computationally acessible manner. This paper describes a Python library and a set of scripts used to query the GO, run enrichment analyses on sets of genes, and describes a novel method for grouping GO terms.
